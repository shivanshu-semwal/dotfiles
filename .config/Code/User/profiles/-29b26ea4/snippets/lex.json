	// Place your snippets for lex here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"basic program": {
		"prefix": "basic",
		"body": [
			"%{",
			"\t// c code",
			"\t#include <stdio.h>",
			"\t#include <stdlib.h>",
			"%}",
			"",
			"%%",
			"",
			"%%",
			"",
			"int main(){",
			"\tyylex();",
			"\treturn 0;",
			"}",
		],
		"description": "basic lex code"
	}
